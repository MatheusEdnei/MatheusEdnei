### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I'm Matheus Ednei (sometimes Matheus Souza).
I'm a software developer, with focus on BackEnd developing, working with JavaScript, TypeScript and Java. I love technology and love the many things that we can create with technology. I think that change the world and make it in a better place.
